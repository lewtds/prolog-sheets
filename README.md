# Prolog Spreadsheets

(tentative name before I come up with something more catchy)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/65a7cf77-eb21-43a1-80d2-1cdd39679f1a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/silly-newton-ec1704/deploys)

A smart, scripted spreadsheet in which you don’t write cell formulas directly but instead write a series of high-level
logic rules to “relate” cell values and cell properties like color or border together. 

I hope this could become a viable application prototyping platform in the near future.

The project is in a very early stage. For now, please check the screenshots/screencaps in the [docs](docs/) folder and
and this collection of sketches in OneNote to get a glimpse of what goes on in my mind: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsPGvKKy2Gsw4BhEquKaQ_WSvaf0

Also check the Netlify link above to play around with it.
