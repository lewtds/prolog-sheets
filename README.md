A smart, scripted spreadsheet in which you don’t write cell formulas directly but instead write a series of high-level
logic rules to “relate” cell values and cell properties like color or border together. 

Ex: *2nd row is 1st row + 2* or
*even rows look darker, based on the color specified at cell B15*.

I hope this could become a viable application prototyping platform in the near future, fixing many of the problems with
spreadsheets as an application building platform, esp. the low reproducibility due to the WYSIWYG nature and the 
hidden-by-default behavior of cell formulas

The project is in a very early stage. For now, please check the screenshots/screencaps in the [docs](docs/) folder and
and this collection of sketches in OneNote to get a glimpse of what goes on in my mind: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsPGvKKy2Gsw4BhEquKaQ_WSvaf0

I'm preparing a simple tutorial but for now, please refer to this quick guide from Wikipedia on [Prolog syntax and
semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog_syntax_and_semantics). 

Come talk to @lewtds at #vnluser at Freenode to pick my brain.
